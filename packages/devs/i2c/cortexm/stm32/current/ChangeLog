	* include/i2c_stm32.h:
	* src/i2c_stm32.c:
	Modify cyg_stm32_i2c_init such that the driver works with a
	STMicroelectronics STM3240G-EVAL board. Tried to preserve
	origonal support for STM32F1XX but have no means of testing.
	Added CDL to allow SMBus mode timeouts, but did not add other
	SMBus feature support. Modify the fast mode frequency calculation
	and verified the driver works at 400Khz. Made some changes to 
	comments. Added code to support ACK/NACK control but commented
	it out to prevent driver lockups. Added some test code for a 
	loopback test that reads/writes a small number of values to the on
	board touch devices.
